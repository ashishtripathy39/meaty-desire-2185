                    There are many travel options available on our sites and we
                    want to make your search results as relevant as possible.
                    That's why we offer lots of ways to help you search for and

                    <p>
                      Our site uses complex, dynamic algorithms to ensure your
                      search results are ordered efficiently.

                      On the search results page, you can select how to sort the

                      only those search results that meet your chosen
                      preferences. If you don’t decide to use these features,
                      then you’ll see our chosen default sort order which orders

                        listed first.

                        Results are ordered starting with the most relevant and
                        competitive offers based on a range of factors,
                        including a property’s offered price compared to its
                        historical prices, its guest rating, number of reviews,
                        number of bookings to date, and location (relative to

                        satisfaction factors, including the range and quality of
                        images and information provided for properties, the
                        number of guest relocations and the number of refunds
                        due to complaints about stays, property availability on

                        a property and such booking is completed is one of the
                        factors taken into consideration when determining the
                        relative order of properties with similar offers in our
                        search results listings. What we are paid recognises the
                        part we play in listing the property on our site,
                        facilitating the booking and facilitating your stay at
                        the property. Where we are displaying properties with a
                        similar offer, then a booking from which we are paid
                        more commission or compensation will feature higher in
                        our search results listing compared to other properties

                        Results are ordered starting with the most relevant and
                        competitive offers based on a range of factors,
                        including a property’s offered price compared to its
                        historical prices, its guest rating, number of reviews,
                        number of bookings to date, and location (relative to
                        your destination search).

                        They are also further differentiated by traveller
                        satisfaction factors, including the range and quality of
                        images and information provided for properties, the
                        number of guest relocations and the number of refunds
                        due to complaints about stays, property availability on
                        our sites, and the overall price competitiveness for our
                        travellers.

                        In addition, how much we are paid (eg: commissions from
                        accommodation or compensation on bookings) when you book
                        a property and such booking is completed is one of the
                        factors taken into consideration when determining the
                        relative order of properties with similar offers in our
                        search results listings. What we are paid recognises the
                        part we play in listing the property on our site,
                        facilitating the booking and facilitating your stay at
                        the property. Where we are displaying properties with a
                        similar offer, then a booking from which we are paid
                        more commission or compensation will feature higher in
                        our search results listing compared to other properties
                        with similar offers where we are paid less commission or
                        compensation on the booking.
